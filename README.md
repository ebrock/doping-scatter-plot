# Doping in Professional Bike Racing.

## Description
This is the first data visualization project from freeCodeCamp.org, using D3. The project tests require non-virtual DOM elements, so a front-end framework (React) will not be used.  

## Usage
This is be a simple scatter graph showing Doping in Professional Bike Racing by visualizing the fastest racing times up Alpe d'Huez and color-coding dopers vs natural riders. The dataset is provided by freeCodeCamp in the project instructions. Here is the [link](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph) for the project.
